 Now we have to push these files on a remote repository like github.
 
 1) create repository
 2) copy repository link 
 3) add remote repository=>git remote add <repository name> <repository url>
 4) git push repo name
 5) git push repo name master
 
 6) git branch <branch name> =>to create branch.
 ==>to shift branches ==>git checkout <branch name>
 Now changes that are happening at new branch willn't be tracked or noticed on master branch.
 For That:
 We have to merge both repositories.
 Commands:
 git checkout master
 git add <filename with extension>
 Now check changes:
 git diff.

 Now Merging Two Branches:
 git merge <file name>
 git merge tool (Solves merging conflict issue)
